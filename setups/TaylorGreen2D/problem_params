2d Taylor Green vortex solutions: in the plane of the vorticity
	(a) inertial balances the pressure gradient
	(b) time dependence balances the diffusion of momentum
	==> exact decaying solutions. Passing these tests in all three orientations validates
	all aspects of the code except for the buoyancy and rotation terms

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I:  treat the plane that the vortices live in as periodic
------------------------------------------------------------------------

XY orientation: 128x128x(16/17)  computed solns match exact solutions to at least 8 digits (all I printed)
	(1) Let the subdomain match the periodic domain (L=1 in all 3 dimensions) and use periodic BCs in all 3 directions
	(2) Same problem but z treated as nonperiodic w/ nz=17   (slower but expected as several O(n) steps > n log n for small n)
	(3) p1=p2=2 decomposition... exact agreement and input/data_tools/concatenate_results.py glues things together

YZ orientation 17x128x128
	(1) nonperiodic in x, p1=p2=2  computed solns match exact solutions to at least 8 digits (all I printed)
	
XZ orientation 128x17x128
	(1) nonperiodic in y, p1=p2=2  computed solns match exact solutions to at least 8 digits (all I printed) 



TO SWITCH BETWEEN XY XZ AND YZ CONFIGURATIONS:
	(1) change nx,ny,nz and periodicity flags here
	(2) make corresponding changes in io_params
	(3) change orientation flag in user_params_module.f90
	

Ignore s1 for these tests: in the plane of the vorticity s1 is advected but has no
counterbalancing pressure gradient, thus it evolves. It behaves differently when the 
transverse direction has (erroneous) BCs applied or when the BCs are periodic. The real
test is on the velocity fields. Showing that these are good in all 3 orientations is
pretty solid evidence of the inertia terms, the diffusion terms and the pressure projection.
