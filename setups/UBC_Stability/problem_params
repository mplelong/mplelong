This is a simple initial value problem for a stratified shear flow in which the shear 
and stratification profiles have unequal and vertically offset characteristic thicknesses. 
It is motivated by the work of Greg Lawrence, Neil Balmforth and their students at UBC.

Parameters defining velocity and density profiles are specified in user_params_module.f90

The "test setup" is configured for a 2d flow in the yz plane and uses 4 processors. 

The flow is periodic in y (and x) with free-slip rigid lids in z.

The initial conditions are unstable and an initial perturbation grows to finite amplitude. 
The instability is vertically asymmetric and has a finite horizontal phase speed.


Will execute by setting FS_XY_PERIODIC to true and s1_z_BC = 'HOMOGENEOUS_NEUMANN'
in user_params/change_defaults.
