Diffusion:
Laplacian diffusion works from nu=kappa= 1.d-1 --> 1.d-19 and with diffusion not called at all
high order with p=4 is now giving me problems, I'm not sure why, but the appear as E/W bdry errors in w


3D:
2d problem (ky=0) with 257x33x129:  solns look fine for at least 150 steps, but slow (p1=p2=1)
2d problem (ky=0) with 129x33x129:  solns look fine for at least 650 steps
2d problem (ky=0) with 129x33x129:  p1=1,p2=2   all good for 1 period integration, much faster as expected

p1>1 with p2=1 is not configured, primary decomposition is in y & z via p2 with additional available via p1

NB  too much high order diffusion causes bad errors that can easily be mistaken for problems
in the EW boundary treatment
